    <p><b>Disclaimer:</b></p>
    <p><b>Liability for content:</b></p>
    <p>
      The content of our pages has been created with the utmost care. However,
      we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the
      content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on
      these pages in accordance with § 7 para. 1 of the German Telemedia Act
      (TMG). However, according to §§ 8 to 10 of the TMG, we are not obligated
      to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate
      circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or
      block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected.
      Liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a
      concrete infringement. Upon becoming aware of any such legal violations,
      we will remove the content immediately.
    </p>
    <p><b>Liability for links:</b></p>
    <p>
      Our offer includes links to external third-party websites, over whose
      content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability
      for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the
      linked pages is always responsible for their content. The linked pages
      were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal
      content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent
      content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete
      evidence of a violation of the law. If we become aware of any legal
      violations, we will remove such links immediately.
    </p>
    <p><b>Copyright:</b></p>
    <p>
      The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are
      subject to German copyright law. The reproduction, editing, distribution,
      and any kind of utilization outside the limits of copyright require the
      written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies
      of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar
      as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the
      copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party
      content is identified as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a
      copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. If we become aware
      of any infringements, we will remove such content immediately.

    <p><b>Data Protection:</b></p>
    <p>
      The use of our website is usually possible without providing personal
      data. As far as personal data (e.g., name, address, or email addresses) is
      collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis, to the
      extent possible. This data will not be disclosed to third parties without
      your explicit consent. We point out that data transmission over the
      Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) may have security
      vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third
      parties is not possible. The use of contact data published within the
      framework of the imprint obligation by third parties for sending
      unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly
      prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take
      legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising
      information, such as spam emails.
