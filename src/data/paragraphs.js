      `During my school years, I became fascinated with software development. Besides 
      attending school, I actively taught myself the programming language C# and gained 
      initial experience with the game engine Unity. My passion for software development 
      was evident in my 10th-grade research paper, which focused on a small game I had 
      programmed. Throughout my time in the upper school, I devoted my free time to 
      mastering the mobile framework Xamarin.Forms. With this knowledge, I developed 
      my first full-fledged app, AbiSax. My proficiency in computer science was further 
      validated when I scored 15 points (the highest grade) in my oral examination. 
      This journey has solidified my passion for software development and affirmed my 
      decision to pursue a career in this field.`,

      significantly expanded my knowledge in the field of software development. My main 
      responsibility has been to independently develop two mobile apps 
      (1. App Maislabyrinth WHS, 2. App coming soon). This experience has provided me
